<html lang="en"> <!-- This tells the browser that this document is HTML code, and in English. -->
    <head>

        <!-- The head is where basic page settings are applied, but no actual page content (you won't see any of this in the browser viewport) -->

        <title></title> <!-- Title of page for search engines + windows/tabs -->

        <!-- Meta tags provide information about the website, but not necessarily used by the site itself - often for search engines, or the browser. -->
        <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /> <!-- Fallback/compatibility tag for telling the browser how to read this code, as HTML. -->
        <meta name="description" content="This webpage is an example template to build a responsive HTML5 website." /> <!-- Description of what the website/content. This is how you do Search Engine Optimisation. -->
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" /> <!-- This sets the page size, and lets you use media queries in CSS for responsiveness -->

        <!--
            Link tags here point to files you want to include in the site, such as icons and stylesheets.
            "rel" = relevance; what the linked file means. "href" = where the file is, either online or relative to this document - never used a full local path (i.e. C:/Users/Name/Documents...index.html). Only reference as far back as the index.html file.
        -->
        <!-- <link rel="shortcut icon" href="media/favicon.png" /> --> <!-- Replace the linked file with your icon. -->

        <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/normalize/7.0.0/normalize.css" /> <!-- This is normalize.css, which resets basic/default styling across browsers, making design and layout easier and more consistent. -->

        <link rel="stylesheet" href="main.css" /> <!-- This links to your custom page styling. -->

        <!-- This links to a webfont, from Google Fonts; this lets you use a font not installed on the user's system. This is Roboto, the Android system font, with all weights, and italics. We'll call this in 'css/main.css' later.  -->
        <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:100,100i,300,300i,400,400i,500,500i,700,700i,900,900i" rel="stylesheet">
    </head>

    <body>
        <!-- This is the body of the webpage - in here are all the things that you will display in the browser viewport: text, images, etc. -->
        <section>
            <!--
                This is a section; it helps split the page neatly, and is good for accessibility, as well as jumping to with a link if need be.
                We'll use this one as a page header.
            -->

        <section class="hero">
            <!-- We've given this section a class; so we can give it unique styling with CSS later, by selecting the class name. -->

                    <img src="ICON.svg" width="15%" >
                     <!-- A div (or division) lets us split the page into chunks that can be worked with and styled more specifically. In this case, we're nesting text inside a div, so we can create an effect in CSS that makes the text more readable. -->
